Before you use this open source free product, I hope you read this instruction in advance.
This product can output Christmas trees using the native output of C programming language on the console. There is no need to use a series of header files in Windows environment, such as <windows.h> , which can be used in any environment.

After you unzip the product package, you will see two folders - "Basic" and "3D". The contents of the two folders can respectively realize a 2D plane Christmas tree with ribbons and ornaments, and a 3D Christmas tree with three-dimensional effects. In these two folders, you can find three more. There is a picture in the "Preview" folder to display the output effect. The other two folders, "C Programming Language File (.c, For All types)" and "UNIX App (For UNIX, Linux and macOS)", display C programming language source code and UNIX executable files respectively. As the folder title says, C programming language source code can be used by any platform, while UNIX executable files are limited to UNIX like and Linux environments (such as macOS).

There are two considerations:

1. The source code is encoded in UTF-8. If you want to view the source code, please call your code editor to use UTF-8 when you open the source code file.

2. Because this product uses a lot of cyclic code, it runs very slowly (sometimes it is normal for a line to pop out in a few minutes, depending on your CPU performance). Please note that you should try to open it with a code editor (such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, some terminal editors "GCC", etc.). Running it on some editors or platforms that limit the memory usage (such as CodeMonkey) may report an error indicating that the memory usage is too large to output.
 
The above are all instructions and precautions. I wish you a smooth use of this product.
